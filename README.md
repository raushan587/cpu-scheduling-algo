CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

I developed a web-based CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer that allows users to input process details and simulate how various scheduling algorithms work in real-time. The tool supports key algorithms including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Round Robin.

The user-friendly interface lets users input process names, burst times, arrival times, and time quantum (for Round Robin). Once the input is provided and an algorithm is selected, the tool dynamically generates a Gantt chart to visually represent the scheduling sequence of processes. It also calculates and displays key efficiency metrics like Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, Response Time, and CPU Utilization, helping users understand how each algorithm performs under different conditions.

The project was built using HTML and Bootstrap for responsive design, ensuring a clean and modern user interface across devices. JavaScript handles all the logic, from parsing user input and simulating the algorithms to rendering the Gantt chart and computing performance metrics. No backend is required, so the tool runs entirely in the browser.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of operating system concepts and apply them in a practical, interactive way. It is especially useful for students learning CPU scheduling, as it bridges the gap between theory and visualization. The interactive design not only enhances engagement but also promotes deeper learning.

In the future, I plan to extend the tool by adding support for Priority Scheduling, saving and exporting results, and enhancing the UI with animations for a better learning experience.
